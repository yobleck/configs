You'll soon find that the Linux "community" is a loosely arranged toxic set of cliques who are their own echo chambers - some more vociferous than others. Holding any kind of tech-related opinion - no matter how well reasoned will draw extreme levels of hostility from some areas.
This is where the internet is leading us in terms of manufacturing "safe spaces" that become deeply opinionated hive-mind echo-chambers, purging "wrong-think" and viciously safeguarding their own particular set of delusions.
The really sad thing is that when you meet these people in real life, they are totally spineless, emotionally crippled and cave in under any kind of pressure.
Do what you want and don't look for validation. In the end, you are right because it is your machine and you can run it how you see fit. You are master of your own destiny and captain of your own ship. Good luck.

Q: Firmware for Air75?
A: The Beta version of firmware for Windows is coming~ Please check it, it has improved a lot compared with the software. Test it if you have an interest.
https://www.dropbox.com/.../NuPhy_Air75_firmware_win... 
About the improvements via the firmware:
1. When the battery charge is lower than 20%, the Del key will flash continuously for one minute to indicate that the battery is low. After charging is connected, the Del key will flash an orange light to indicate that it is charging until the charging is completed.
2. The sidelight settings can be kept after the keyboard is turned off.
3. The sidelights have changed from the original only 4 gears with adjustable brightness to 5 gears
4. FN+TAB+F can adjust the F area to F1-F12, Fn+F1—F12 are media keys, and the settings before the keyboard is turned off will be kept.
5. The keyboard will automatically connect with your devices after it restarts or the sleep mode off
6. After turning off the keyboard backlight and sidelights, the boost capacitor will be turned off to save power.
