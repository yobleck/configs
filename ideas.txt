star wars quote paraphrased to talk about twitter/4chan:

    suddenly cried out in anger and 
    wouldn't stop. I fear we have created
    something terrible.

You'll soon find that the Linux "community" is a loosely arranged toxic set of cliques who are their own echo chambers - some more vociferous than others. Holding any kind of tech-related opinion - no matter how well reasoned will draw extreme levels of hostility from some areas.
This is where the internet is leading us in terms of manufacturing "safe spaces" that become deeply opinionated hive-mind echo-chambers, purging "wrong-think" and viciously safeguarding their own particular set of delusions.
The really sad thing is that when you meet these people in real life, they are totally spineless, emotionally crippled and cave in under any kind of pressure.
Do what you want and don't look for validation. In the end, you are right because it is your machine and you can run it how you see fit. You are master of your own destiny and captain of your own ship. Good luck.
